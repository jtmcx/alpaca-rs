# alpaca-rs

⚠️ *This is an abandoned project. You probably want to use [apca][1].* ⚠️

At the beginning of the pandemic, I started writing a rust API for
[alpaca.markets][2]. I ran out of free time and abandoned the project. I
didn't get very far with it.  It's uploaded here in its broken state
for posterity. A few stable rust libraries have since appeared (e.g.,
[apca][1]).
